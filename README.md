# CapsuleNetwork
Tensorflow implementation of a capsule network based on the paper Dynamic Routing Between Capsules

Although this project will run and learn to predict the digits and reconstruction vectors, it contains logical errors in the routing function as well as the squashing function.
I will be uploading a new project that contains capsules that fixes these problems.
